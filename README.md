<h1>Tools and Libraries Used</h1>

Python for programming. Googler colab: Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib: for data visualization. TensorFlow and Keras: for any machine learning models, such as classification of deforested areas.

<h1Data Source(s)</h1>

the data for this project primarily comes from publicly available reports and data sets.

<h1>Execution Steps (How to Run the Project)</h1>

To run this project, first, make sure Python is installed on your computer. Then, install the required libraries by running pip install matplotlib numpy in your terminal or command prompt. Copy the code into a Python file and save it. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved, open a terminal in that location, and execute the script using the command python plot_data.py. Once the script runs, it will display the bar charts in a pop-up window.

<h1>Summary of Results</h1>

This project shows environmental data like pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Turbidity, and Nitrate Levels for different regions from 2018 to 2021 using bar charts. Python with Matplotlib and NumPy was used to make the charts. The graphs help compare trends and differences between the regions. It also shows how important clean data is for making good visuals. Overall, it gives a clear idea of how the environment changes across regions.

<h1>Challenges Faced</h1>
<br>
Some challenges faced in this project were ensuring the data was accurately represented across different regions and years, and making sure the bar charts were formatted consistently. Choosing the right colors for clear visualization was also a bit tricky. There were also a few issues with aligning the labels properly and debugging minor errors in the code.
